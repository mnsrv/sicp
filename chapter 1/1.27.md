## Exercise 1.27

> Demonstrate that the Carmichael numbers listed in Footnote 47 really do fool the Fermat test. That is, write a procedure that takes an integer n and tests whether an is congruent to a modulo n for every `a < n`, and try your procedure on the given Carmichael numbers.

> Numbers that fool the Fermat test are called Carmichael numbers, and little is known about them other than that they are extremely rare. There are 255 Carmichael numbers below 100,000,000. The smallest few are 561, 1105, 1729, 2465, 2821, and 6601. In testing primality of very large numbers chosen at random, the chance of stumbling upon a value that fools the Fermat test is less than the chance that cosmic radiation will cause the computer to make an error in carrying out a “correct” algorithm. Considering an algorithm to be inadequate for the first reason but not for the second illustrates the difference between mathematics and engineering.

## Solution

First let's demonstrate that the Carmichael number (for example first one: 561) really do fool the Fermat test.

```
n = 561
a = 389 ; random number

(expmod 389 561 561) = 389
       base exp m

(remainder
          (* 389 (expmod 389 560 561))
          561) = (remainder (* 389 1) 561) = 389

(remainder
          (square (expmod 389 280 561))
          561) = (remainder (square 1) 561) = 1

(remainder
          (square (expmod 389 140 561))
          561) = (remainder (square 67) 561) = 1

(remainder
          (square (expmod 389 70 561))
          561) = (remainder (square 463) 561) = 67

(remainder
          (square (expmod 389 35 561))
          561) = (remainder (square 287) 561) = 463

(remainder
          (* 389 (expmod 389 34 561))
          561) = (remainder (* 389 256) 561) = 287

(remainder
          (square (expmod 389 17 561))
          561) = (remainder (square 511) 561) = 256

(remainder
          (* 389 (expmod 389 16 561))
          561) = (remainder (square 103) 561) = 511

(remainder
          (square (expmod 389 8 561))
          561) = (remainder (square 460) 561) = 103

(remainder
          (square (expmod 389 4 561))
          561) = (remainder (square 322) 561) = 460

(remainder
          (square (expmod 389 2 561))
          561) = (remainder (square 412) 561) = 322

(remainder
          (square (expmod 389 1 561))
          561) = (remainder (square 389) 561) = 412

(remainder
          (* 389 (expmod 389 0 561))
          561) = (remainder (* 389 1) 561) = 389

(expmod 389 0 561) = 1, and go back

(= (expmod a n n) a)
(= (expmod 389 561 561) 389) = true, wow
```

now I need to write procedure `carmichael-test` to test all numbers less than n

```racket
(define (carmichael-test n)
  (define (try-it a)
    (cond [(= a 0) #t]
          [(= (expmod a n n) a) (try-it (- a 1))]
          [else #f]))
  (try-it (- n 1)))
```

Running this procedure to some carmichael numbers (561, 1105, 1729, 2465, 2821, and 6601) gives `true`.
