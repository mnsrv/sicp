## Exercise 1.22

> Most Lisp implementations include a primitive called runtime that returns an integer that specifies the amount of time the system has been running (measured, for example, in microseconds). The following timed-prime-test procedure, when called with an integer n, prints n and checks to see if n is prime. If n is prime, the procedure prints three asterisks followed by the amount of time used in performing the test.

> (define (timed-prime-test n)
>   (newline)
>   (display n)
>   (start-prime-test n (runtime)))
>
> (define (start-prime-test n start-time)
>   (if (prime? n)
>       (report-prime (- (runtime)

>   (display elapsed-time))

> Using this procedure, write a procedure `search-for-primes` that checks the primality of consecutive odd integers in a specified range. Use your procedure to find the three smallest primes larger than 1000; larger than 10,000; larger than 100,000; larger than 1,000,000. Note the time needed to test each prime. Since the testing algorithm has order of growth of ${\mathrm\Theta(\sqrt n)}$, you should expect that testing for primes around 10,000 should take about $\sqrt {10}$ times as long as testing for primes around 1000. Do your timing data bear this out? How well do the data for 100,000 and 1,000,000 support the ${\mathrm\Theta(\sqrt n)}$ prediction? Is your result compatible with the notion that programs on your machine run in time proportional to the number of steps required for the computation?

## Solution

I understand that I can change this procedures, or rather implement my own versions of them to achieve result. Because otherwise it makes no sense. I think `consecutive` means that procedure should search for prime numbers without stoping. So when we find first prime, we go and try next odd integer, not back to start.

```racket
(define (search-for-primes count n)
  (define (report-prime n elapsed-time)
    (newline)
    (display "|")
    (display n)
    (display "|")
    (display elapsed-time)
    (display "|")
    (search-for-primes (- count 1) (+ n 2)))
  (define (timed-search-for-primes n start-time)
    (cond ((even? n) (timed-search-for-primes (+ 1 n) start-time))
          ((prime? n) (report-prime n (- (runtime) start-time)))
          (else (timed-search-for-primes (+ 2 n) start-time))))
  (if (> count 0)
      (timed-search-for-primes n (runtime))
      (newline)))
```

Due to modern computation powers I will try to test larger numbers. I'm using Macbook Pro with M2 Pro chip.

Let's check ratio between first numbers in groups

| pow | avg time | sqrt n | ratio |
| --- | -------: | -----: | ----: |
| 3   |       10 |     31 |       |
| 4   |       11 |    100 |  1.10 |
| 5   |       19 |    316 |  1.73 |
| 6   |       31 |   1000 |  1.63 |
| 7   |       89 |   3162 |  2.87 |
| 8   |      197 |  10000 |  2.21 |
| 9   |      566 |  31627 |  2.87 |
| 10  |     1400 | 100000 |  2.47 |
| 11  |     3962 | 316227 |  2.83 |

Ratio for my calculations was less than $\sqrt {10} = 3.16$. Maybe checking only odd numbers a little bit optimized calculations. But still $\sqrt {n}$ is good aproximation of time
