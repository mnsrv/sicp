## Exercise 1.25

> Alyssa P. Hacker complains that we went to a lot of extra work in writing expmod. After all, she says, since we already know how to compute exponentials, we could have simply written
>
> ```racket
> (define (expmod base exp m)
>   (remainder (fast-expt base exp) m))
> ```
>
> Is she correct? Would this procedure serve as well for our fast prime tester? Explain.

## Solution

Funny, I had the same question when reading chapter. My theory is that she is not right, but I dont see why. Maybe big numbers?

Yes. Despite fast-expt in Alice version is using squaring as well, it first calculates exp and only after that tries to get remainder of that sometimes enourmous number. Reading other people solutions, they mention fixnum arithmetic vs arbitrary precision arithmetic.

Original procedure on the other hand gets remainder in each step, so it basically dealing with very small numbers every time. So Alice's version is not efficient and may take a lot of memory to hold intermediate result.
