## Exercise 1.24

> Modify the timed-prime-test procedure of Exercise 1.22 to use fast-prime? (the Fermat method), and test each of the 12 primes you found in that exercise. Since the Fermat test has Θ(logn) growth, how would you expect the time to test primes near 1,000,000 to compare with the time needed to test primes near 1000? Do your data bear this out? Can you explain any discrepancy you find?

## Solution

```racket
(define (expmod base exp m)
  (cond ((= exp 0) 1)
        ((even? exp) (remainder (square (expmod base (/ exp 2) m)) m))
        (else (remainder (* base (expmod base (- exp 1) m)) m))))

(define (fermat-test n)
  (define (try-it a)
    (= (expmod a n n) a))
  (try-it (+ 1 (random (- n 1)))))

(define (fast-prime? n times)
  (cond ((= times 0) true)
        ((fermat-test n) (fast-prime? n (- times 1)))
        (else false)))
```

Since `prime?` is Θ(√n) and Fermat test Θ(logn) times for prime number 1000000007 should be decrease from √1000000007 = 527 to log1000000007 = 9. My results are

| pow |      prime | prime? | fast-prime? |
| --- | ---------: | -----: | ----------: |
| 3   |       1009 |     20 |          60 |
| 3   |       1013 |     20 |          73 |
| 3   |       1019 |     20 |          80 |
| 4   |      10007 |     20 |          81 |
| 4   |      10009 |     20 |          79 |
| 4   |      10037 |     20 |          80 |
| 5   |     100003 |     25 |          88 |
| 5   |     100019 |     24 |          93 |
| 5   |     100043 |     26 |          86 |
| 6   |    1000003 |     41 |         108 |
| 6   |    1000033 |     41 |         100 |
| 6   |    1000037 |     41 |         110 |
| 7   |   10000019 |     70 |         123 |
| 7   |   10000079 |     70 |         120 |
| 7   |   10000103 |     70 |         128 |
| 8   |  100000007 |    226 |         135 |
| 8   |  100000037 |    205 |         148 |
| 8   |  100000039 |    209 |         150 |
| 9   | 1000000007 |    539 |         143 |
| 9   | 1000000009 |    576 |         144 |
| 9   | 1000000021 |    507 |         143 |

We can see that `fast-prime?` for primes around 1,000 is slower than `prime?`, but for primes around 1,000,000,000 is faster. It's because logariphmic function grows slower than √n

Also noted that adding x10 for prime number gives around constant times ${\log(100)-\log(10)=1}$

Also noted that using less than 100 is decrease time, but this is random chosen number.
